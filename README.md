# AI_tic_tac_toe

### How it works

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to have three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game ends when one player achieves this goal or when the board is full (a draw).

Using the `chrono` library in C++, I wrote an "AI" that allows the player to play solo against the clock of the computer.
